🔐 Password Strength Checker in Python
✨ A Simple Yet Smart Way to Evaluate Password Security
🚀 Overview:

This project is a Password Strength Checker built using Python that evaluates how strong a password is based on several key factors. It helps users understand the quality of their passwords and guides them to improve weak ones.
🧠 Features:

    ✅ Checks for length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters

    🔢 Calculates entropy to estimate how hard the password is to crack

    ⚠️ Warns if the password contains common dictionary words like "password" or "123456"

    🎯 Gives a clear strength rating: Weak, Moderate, or Strong

    📋 Provides human-readable feedback to help improve the password

🧪 Sample Output:

Enter a password to check: Hello123!
🟢 Strong password
🔢 Entropy: 52.7 bits

🧮 What is Entropy?

Entropy is a measure of password randomness and unpredictability, expressed in bits.
The higher the entropy, the more secure your password is against brute-force attacks.
For example, a password with 60+ bits of entropy is considered strong.
📂 Technologies Used:

    Python 3

    re (regex for pattern checks)

    math (for entropy calculation)

📌 What Makes This Project Special:

Instead of just checking for symbols and length, this checker calculates entropy and detects dictionary-based weaknesses, making it a smarter alternative to typical checkers.
💡 Future Improvements:

    Integrate with HaveIBeenPwned API to check if the password has appeared in data breaches

    Add a GUI or Web Interface using Tkinter or Flask

    Add real-time feedback while typing
